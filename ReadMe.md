# Portfolio
A selection of a few works from my time at UNF

#### Programming Project
A programming project from Programming 2, and the most complicated program I've written.
It's nothing particularly advanced, but should demonstrate I know enough programming for basic data manipulation tasks.

#### Statistics Capstone Random Forest Presentation
A presentation I recently gave on Random Forest statistical models for my statistics capstone. An explanation of the method via application to credit card fraud data.
Most of the data manipulation was done using Kaggle.

#### Econonometrics Paper
A paper anaylising the accurary of the pseudo-prediction market metaculus, written as the final project for my econometrics class.

#### Germany-Belgium Study Abroad Reflection
A short piece on my study abroad trip. More relaxed writing style.

#### Aging Roll20 White Paper
A white paper on issues plaguing the tabletop gaming platform Roll20, describing problems and solutions (namely, jumping ship to one of several different platforms)
