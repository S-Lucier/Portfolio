# Portfolio
A selection of a few works from my time at UNF

#### Programming 2 Project
This is a programming project from my Programming 2 class that takes creates a simple ticket system to assign work orders to employees based on a few characteristics.
It's nothing advanced, but should demonstrate I know enough programming for basic data manipulation tasks, and I could learn more if needed.

#### Statistics Capstone Random Forest Presentation
A presentation I recently gave on Random Forest statistical models for my statistics capstone. An explanation of the method via application to credit card fraud data.
Most of the data manipulation was done using Kaggle.

#### Econonometrics Paper
A paper analyzing the accuracy of the pseudo-prediction market metaculus, written as the final project for my econometrics class.

#### Germany-Belgium Study Abroad Reflection
A short piece on my study abroad trip. More relaxed writing style.

#### Aging Roll20 White Paper
A white paper on issues plaguing the tabletop gaming platform Roll20, describing problems and solutions for users of the plactform.

#### [Pf2e Combat Sim (WIP)](https://github.com/S-Lucier/Pf2eCombatSim)
A Monte Carlo sim I'm writing to level up my coding skills and solve some questions the pf2e optimization community has about damage variabilityâ€™s effect on survival chance. Very much a work in progress right now, I have the basic data structure for characters, attacks, etc. mostly done but I still need to write the file scanning and sim - though the file scanning is quite boilerplate.
