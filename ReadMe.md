# Portfolio
A selection of a few works from my time at UNF

#### Programming Project
A programming project from Programming 2, and the most complicated program I've written.
It's nothing particularly advanced, but should demonstrate I know enough programming for basic data manipulation tasks.

#### Econonometrics Paper
A paper anaylising the accurary of the psueo-prediction market metaculus, written as the final project for my econometics class.

#### Germany-Belgium Study Abroad Reflection
A short piece on my study abroad trip. More relaxed writing style.

#### Aging Roll20 White Paper
A white paper on issues plaguing the tabletop gaming platform Roll20, describing problems and solutions (namely, jumping ship to one of several different platforms)
